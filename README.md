# Disease-Detection-App

# This repository contains a Python application built with Flask and scikit-learn that detects whether a person is diagnosed with a certain disease based on input data. The app uses a decision tree classifier model to predict the diagnosis and provides results via a web interface.
Features

    Simple and Interactive Web Interface: Allows users to input relevant health data and view predictions.
    Machine Learning Model: Uses a decision tree classifier for disease diagnosis.
    User-Friendly: Displays clear results as "Positive" or "Negative" for disease diagnosis.
# Model Overview
     The decision tree model was trained using a dataset containing features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. The target variable represents the diagnosis, with values such as "Positive" (disease detected) or          "Negative" (disease not detected).
